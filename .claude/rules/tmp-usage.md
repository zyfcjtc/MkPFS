Use `./tmp/` for transient work only: planning notes, scratch files, ad hoc exports, generated reports, and other temporary artifacts.

Keep one-off filenames descriptive enough to find later, but never rely on anything in `./tmp/` as permanent project state.

Do not commit files from `./tmp/`.

If a task needs a temporary helper script or intermediate output, put it under `./tmp/` and delete it when the work is done.

Prefer `./tmp/<task-name>/` for grouped work so a single task can be cleaned up quickly.
